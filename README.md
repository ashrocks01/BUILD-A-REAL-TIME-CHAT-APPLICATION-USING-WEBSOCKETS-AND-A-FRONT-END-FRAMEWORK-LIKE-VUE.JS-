#This is a real time chat application using vue.js. To make it realtime I have used websocket.
After coding, I run it on two browswer tabs. When I sent messgae on one tab,I was able to receive message on another tab immidiately.
Its like our chat apps like whatsapp. Sent messgae is on right side and recieved message on left side. I have also included emojis.
